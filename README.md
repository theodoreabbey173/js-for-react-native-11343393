# Array Manipulation and User Profile Creation

**Student ID:** [11343393]

This project consists of four tasks:

**Task 1:** 
Create a JavaScript file `arrayManipulation.js` with a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers, squares each even number, and triples each odd number.

**Task 2:** 
Add a function `formatArrayStrings` to `arrayManipulation.js` that takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizing the entire string if the number is even, and converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

**Task 3:** 
Create a JavaScript file `userInfo.js` with a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. The function returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
